# [Method Name]

## Description
- Provide a brief and clear description of the method, its purpose, and what it aims to achieve.
For example,
4TCT is a specialized tool designed for the efficient collection of textual data from the 4chan platform. It automates the process of gathering posts from various boards, aiming to facilitate research and analysis in social science and computational linguistics.
This tool is particularly useful for analyzing online discourse, community dynamics, and trends within the 4chan ecosystem. It can support studies on topics like meme culture, information dissemination, and the impact of anonymous social media on public opinion.

## Social Science Usecase(s)
- Include usecases from social sciences that would make this method applicable in a certain scenario.
For example,
A team of social scientists is conducting a research project to explore online communities' influence on language evolution and cultural trends. They decide to focus on 4chan, known for its anonymous and varied user base, to capture authentic and unfiltered expressions. The 4chan Data Collection Tool becomes an essential component in their data acquisition strategy.

## Structure
- Explain the overall structure of the method, including directories, key files, and their functions.
For example,
The tool's architecture includes a src/ directory for core scripts, with requester.py handling data collection, board.py managing board-specific requests, and utils.py for auxiliary functions. Data is stored in a data/ directory created upon initiation, and documentation is available in docs/.


## Environment Setup
- Setting up the envornment to run this method locally
- Installing all the packages and libraries with specific versions required to run this method
For example, 
Requires Python 3.10.2 or 3.11.4. Suitable for environments focused on data collection and analysis.
Dependencies are listed in requirements.txt and can be installed via pip install -r requirements.txt to ensure the tool functions correctly.


## Hardware Requirements (Optional)
- The hardware requirements may be needed in specific cases when a method is known to require more memory/compute power. 
- The method need to be executed on a specific architecture (GPUs, Hadoop cluster etc.)
