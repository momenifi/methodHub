This tutorial will guide you through the process of finding tweets that are similar to a specific text or tweet. You will learn about techniques for measuring similarity between texts and how to implement them in Python.

## Target Audience (Difficulty level)
This tutorial is suitable for intermediate Python programmers.


## Prerequisites
Before starting this tutorial, you should have the following:
- Basic knowledge of Python programming language
- Familiarity with text processing libraries such as NLTK or spaCy

## Environment Setup

**How to Use:**

- **Install Python and Jupyter Notebook (Optional):**
  - If you don't have Python and Jupyter Notebook installed on your system, you can follow these steps:
    1. Install Python from the official website: [Python Downloads](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
    2. After installing Python, you can install Jupyter Notebook using pip:
       ```
       pip install notebook
       ```
    3. Once Jupyter Notebook is installed, you can proceed to the next step.

- **Run on Google Colab (Alternative):**
  - If you prefer not to install Python and Jupyter Notebook locally, you can run the notebook on Google Colab, a cloud-based platform for running Python notebooks.
    1. Open your web browser and go to [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).
    2. Click on "File" > "Upload Notebook" and select the notebook file "Looking up the tweets.ipynb" from your local machine.
    3. Before uploading, compress the folder containing the notebook file and other necessary files into a zip file.
    4. Once the zip file is uploaded, extract its contents in Google Colab.
    5. Open the notebook "Looking up the tweets.ipynb" and execute the code cells as instructed in the tutorial.

## Tutorial content
In this tutorial, we'll use Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH) to search a document. The following sections will be covered:
- Getting the Document Embeddings
- Looking up the Tweets
- Finding the most Similar Tweets with LSH
- Getting the Hash Number for a Vector
- Creating a Hash Table
- Creating all Hash Tables

## Duration
It will take approximately 30-60 minutes to read the tutorial and follow along with the steps.


## Social Science Use Cases

Although Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH) is commonly associated with computational tasks like document similarity search, it can also find applications in social science research. Here are a few potential use cases:

- **Social Media Analysis**: Researchers often study social media data to understand public opinion, sentiment trends, and user behavior. LSH can be applied to efficiently search through large volumes of social media posts to identify similar content or detect patterns in user engagement.

- **Content Analysis**: In social science research, content analysis is used to examine textual data for themes, sentiment, or linguistic patterns. LSH can aid in this process by quickly identifying similar documents or tweets, allowing researchers to analyze a representative subset of data rather than the entire corpus.

- **Cultural Studies**: LSH can be utilized to compare cultural artifacts such as literature, music, or art. For example, researchers analyzing trends in popular culture may use LSH to identify similarities between different works or to track the spread of ideas across social networks.

- **Political Science**: Understanding political discourse and public opinion is crucial in political science research. LSH can assist in analyzing large collections of political speeches, news articles, or social media posts to identify common themes, influential figures, or emerging trends.

- **Psychological Research**: LSH can support psychological research by facilitating the analysis of textual data from sources such as online forums, support groups, or therapy sessions. Researchers can use LSH to identify similar narratives or patterns of behavior, aiding in the study of mental health issues or social interactions.

Overall, while LSH is primarily a computational technique, its applications extend beyond traditional domains into social science research, offering valuable tools for data analysis and interpretation.






## Flow Diagram (Optional)
Below is a simplified flow diagram illustrating the process of using Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH) to search for similar tweets within a document corpus:

graph TD;
A[Input Document Corpus] --> B[Generate Document Embeddings];
B --> C[Construct Hash Tables];
C --> D[Hash Query Tweet];
D --> E[Lookup Similar Tweets];
E --> F[Retrieve Similar Tweets];
F --> G[Output Similar Tweets];


In this flow:

- **Input Document Corpus**: This is the collection of documents or tweets that will be used for similarity search.
- **Generate Document Embeddings**: The documents are transformed into vector embeddings using techniques like Word2Vec or Doc2Vec.
- **Construct Hash Tables**: Hash tables are created to index the document embeddings based on their hash values.
- **Hash Query Tweet**: The query tweet is hashed to obtain its hash value.
- **Lookup Similar Tweets**: Similar tweets are identified by searching the hash tables for documents with matching hash values.
- **Retrieve Similar Tweets**: The tweets identified as similar are retrieved from the document corpus.
- **Output Similar Tweets**: The similar tweets are presented as the final output of the search process.


## Sample Input and output data (Optional)
###Input:
Here is a tweet to search in all tweets:
'#FollowFriday @France_Inte @PKuchly57 @Milipol_Paris for being top engaged members in my community this week :)'

###Output:
Here are two most similar tweets to the given tweet:
