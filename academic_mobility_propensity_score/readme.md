Propensity Score Matching Method
Upfront Information
Description

The propensity score matching method is used to estimate the causal effect of a treatment, intervention, or exposure by balancing covariates between treatment and control groups. It aims to reduce bias and confounding in observational studies by creating comparable groups based on propensity scores.

In this example, this method is employed to estimate the causal effect of academic mobility on research productivity and collaboration indicators among researchers. Academic mobility, represented by the treatment variable "mobile," distinguishes between researchers who have experienced academic mobility to other countries (mobile = 1) and those who have not (mobile = 0). The method aims to balance covariates such as region, main field of study, international co-authorship, gender, GDP per capita of the researcher's origin country, and age, between mobile and non-mobile researchers. By balancing covariates through propensity score matching, the method allows for a more accurate assessment of the impact of academic mobility on key research metrics, including CPP (citations per paper), PPY (number of papers per year), and COPP (co-authors per paper).

SMD quantifies the standardized difference in means between two groups, typically the treatment and control groups, by dividing the difference in means by the standard deviation of the outcome variable. It is commonly used in propensity score matching to assess balance between groups, with a lower SMD indicating better balance and greater comparability in terms of covariates. SMD facilitates comparing effect sizes across different studies or analyses, especially when outcome variables have different scales. In the context of this method, SMD is calculated for both unmatched and matched data to evaluate the balance achieved after matching. The treatment group consists of researchers who have experienced academic mobility to other countries (mobile = 1), while the control group consists of researchers who have not experienced academic mobility (mobile = 0).

The Mean Difference for each variable of interest (CPP, PPY, COPP) quantifies the average difference in these research productivity and collaboration indicators between mobile and non-mobile researchers. A positive Mean Difference indicates that mobile researchers, on average, have higher values of the respective metric compared to non-mobile researchers. For example, a positive Mean Difference in CPP suggests that mobile researchers receive more citations per paper than non-mobile researchers. Conversely, a negative Mean Difference indicates that mobile researchers, on average, have lower values of the respective metric compared to non-mobile researchers. Understanding the sign and magnitude of Mean Differences provides insights into the direction and magnitude of the impact of academic mobility on research productivity and collaboration indicators.

Social Science Use Cases
Impact of Education Programs on Student Outcomes:

Researchers may use PSM to evaluate the effectiveness of educational interventions, such as tutoring programs or online learning platforms, on academic achievement, graduation rates, and other student outcomes. The treatment group could consist of students who participated in the program, while the control group could include similar students who did not participate.
Assessment of Health Interventions:

PSM can be used to assess the impact of health interventions, such as vaccination campaigns, smoking cessation programs, or mental health interventions, on health outcomes and behaviors. The treatment group could comprise individuals who received the intervention, while the control group could include individuals who did not receive the intervention but are similar in terms of relevant covariates.
Evaluation of Employment Training Programs:

Researchers may employ PSM to evaluate the effectiveness of employment training programs, job placement services, or vocational education programs on employment outcomes, earnings, and job stability. The treatment group could include program participants, while the control group could consist of individuals with similar characteristics who did not participate in the program.
Impact of Welfare Policies on Household Income:

PSM can be used to evaluate the impact of welfare policies, such as cash transfer programs or social assistance programs, on household income, poverty rates, and economic well-being. The treatment group could comprise households that received the welfare benefits, while the control group could include similar households that did not receive the benefits.
Analysis of Housing Assistance Programs:

Researchers may employ PSM to analyze the impact of housing assistance programs, such as rental subsidies or affordable housing initiatives, on housing stability, homelessness rates, and housing affordability. The treatment group could include households that received housing assistance, while the control group could consist of similar households that did not receive the assistance.
Evaluation of Environmental Policies:

PSM can be used to assess the impact of environmental policies, such as pollution control measures or renewable energy subsidies, on environmental outcomes, public health indicators, and quality of life. The treatment group could comprise communities or regions affected by the policies, while the control group could include similar communities or regions unaffected by the policies. 




Structure
The method consists of two main functions:

perform_propensity_matching: Conducts propensity score matching usnig  "Nearest Neighbor Matching" method and calculates standardized mean differences (SMDs) for unmatched and matched data.
calculate_mean_diff: Calculates mean differences, t-values, and standard errors for variables of interest between treatment and control groups.
