# Applying Propensity Score Matching in R

## Description
Propensity score matching is a method employed across diverse fields of research to assess the causal impact of treatments, interventions, or exposures in observational studies. By equating covariates between treatment and control groups, it mitigates bias and confounding, thereby enabling the estimation of causal effects. 

In essence, propensity score matching constructs control and treatment groups that are highly comparable in terms of their individual characteristics. This process mitigates the influence of potential confounders, thus facilitating more accurate causal inferences.

To elucidate, consider an example where two distinct groups of entities, represented by balls or ducks in our illustrations, are subjected to different conditions â€“ treatment and control. The initial setup shows these entities with varying characteristics, such as size and color. The subsequent arrangement, either through sorting or linking, aims to pair entities with similar attributes across the treatment and control groups.

In the ball analogy, balls of similar size and color are matched between the treatment and control groups, creating pairs where each treated entity corresponds to a similar untreated entity. Similarly, in the duck analogy, ducks with comparable features, like color and size, are connected to their counterparts in the comparison group, ensuring a balanced representation.

It is used to construct control/treatment groups in scientific studies, in such a way that individuals in the control group are as similar as possible to individuals in the treatment group. 


## Social Science Use Cases
- **Education Policy Evaluation**: [Assessing the impact of educational interventions on student outcomes](https://telearn.hal.science/hal-00190019/document)
Description: This involves assessing the effects of educational interventions, such as curriculum changes, teaching methods, or educational programs, on student outcomes. Researchers use propensity score matching to compare the outcomes of students who received the intervention with those who did not, while controlling for potential confounding variables like socioeconomic status or prior academic achievement.

Example: A study might examine the impact of a new teaching method on student performance in mathematics. By matching students who received the new method with similar students who did not, researchers can determine whether the intervention led to improvements in math scores.

## Structure
The method consists of two main functions located in  ["propensity_matching_functions.R"](https://github.com/momenifi/methodHub/blob/main/academic_mobility_propensity_score/method/propensity_matching_functions.R):
1. `perform_propensity_matching`: Conducts propensity score matching and calculates standardized mean differences (SMDs) for unmatched and matched data.
2. `calculate_mean_diff`: Calculates mean differences, t-values, and standard errors for variables of interest between treatment and control groups.

## Keywords
Propensity score matching, Causal inference, Observational studies, Social science research, Methodology.

## Setup
### Environment Setup
To run this method locally, ensure you have R (version  3.6.0 or higher) installed on your system.

### Installing Dependencies
Install the required R packages:
- Matching
- tableone

### How to Use
1. Download  ["mydata_sample.csv"](https://github.com/momenifi/methodHub/blob/main/academic_mobility_propensity_score/method/mydata_sample.csv), ["propensity_matching_functions.R"](https://github.com/momenifi/methodHub/blob/main/academic_mobility_propensity_score/method/propensity_matching_functions.R), and ["main_script.R"](https://github.com/momenifi/methodHub/blob/main/academic_mobility_propensity_score/method/main_script.R) in a folder.
2. Run the commands in "main_script.R"
    - Load the input dataset into R (data_sample) (lines 1 to 5)
    - Define the functions (line 8)
    - Define the treatment variable (treatment_var) and covariates (covariates)(lines 11 and 12)
    - Call the `perform_propensity_matching` function to conduct propensity score matching (line 15) with parameters data_sample, treatment_var, and covariates.  
      The output contains SMDs of unmatched/matched data (unmatched_smd in line 20)/matched_smd in line 21) and 
    - Define the variables of interest (vars_of_interest) (line 29) and Matched data (matched_data in line 24)
    - Call the `calculate_mean_diff` function to calculate mean differences for variables of interest (line 33) with parameteres matched_data, treatment_var, and vars_of_interest. The output gets the mean differences of vars_of_interest. 


## Usage
### Input Data (DBD datasets)
This method can work with any dataset containing variables of interest, a treatment indicator, and covariates.

### Sample Input Data
Sample input data can be provided in CSV format with columns representing variables of interest (PPY, COPP, CPP), a treatment indicator (MOBILE), and covariates (REGION, MAIN_FIELD, INTERNATIONAL_COAUTHOR, GENDER, GDP_PC_ORIGIN, AGE). (mydata_sample.csv).
Here is a screenshot of sample input data:

### Sample Output

The output includes standardized mean differences (SMD) for both unmatched and matched data, along with mean differences, t-values, and standard errors for the variables of interest.

By examining the SMD for unmatched and matched data under different covariances, we assess the effectiveness of the matching process in achieving balance between the treatment and control groups. A lower SMD indicates a smaller difference between the two groups. For instance, in this example, the SMD for the variable "AGE" is 0.34 for unmatched data and 0.03 for matched data. This suggests that the treatment group in the matched data is more similar to the control group compared to the unmatched data.

**Main difference:**

A mean difference of 3.04 for the variable CPP indicates that, on average, the treatment group's CPP value is 3.04 units higher than that of the control group.
